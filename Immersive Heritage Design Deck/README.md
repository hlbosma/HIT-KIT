## üÉè Immersive Heritage Design Deck

The **Immersive Heritage Design Deck** is a collection of cards designed to support your creative process when working with Extended Reality (XR) in the context of cultural heritage.

Each card offers prompts, examples, and insights to help you:

* **Explore** how XR can meaningfully connect with heritage content
* **Generate ideas** and new directions during brainstorming
* **Reflect** on the impact of your design choices
* **Communicate** key concepts with peers, stakeholders, or collaborators
* **Test and refine** your concepts by considering practical and ethical implications

Use the deck flexibly: draw a card to spark new thinking, use a full set to structure a co-creation session, or refer back to specific cards when you're stuck or need fresh perspective.

> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The full card deck is part of your physical toolkit.
