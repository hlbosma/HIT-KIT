## üß© Digital Building Blocks

The **Digital Building Blocks** are ready-to-use templates that help you quickly start prototyping interactions between physical components and immersive digital environments.

These blocks are designed to lower the technical barrier and let you focus on **creative experimentation**. Whether you‚Äôre new to coding or just want to save time, they provide a solid foundation to build from.

What‚Äôs included:

* **ItsyBitsy templates** (using CircuitPython) for working with sensors, actuators, and input/output logic
* **Unreal Engine projects** to get started with XR environments

You can use these as-is or modify them to fit your project. They‚Äôre here to help you move quicklu from idea to interaction.
