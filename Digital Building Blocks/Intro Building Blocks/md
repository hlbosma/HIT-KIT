## ğŸ§© Digital Building Blocks

The **Digital Building Blocks** are ready-to-use templates that help you quickly start prototyping interactions between physical components and immersive digital environments.

These blocks are designed to lower the technical barrier and let you focus on **creative experimentation**. Whether youâ€™re new to coding or just want to save time, they provide a solid foundation to build from.

Whatâ€™s included:

* **ItsyBitsy templates** (using CircuitPython) for working with sensors, actuators, and input/output logic
* **Unreal Engine blueprints** to get started with XR environments
* **Communication scripts** that let your microcontroller and Unreal Engine talk to each other

You can use these as-is or modify them to fit your project. Theyâ€™re here to help you move from idea to interactionâ€”fast.
