# HIT-KIT: Heritage through Immersive Technologies Toolkit

Welcome to the **HIT-KIT**, a toolkit designed to support designers in exploring and applying **Extended Reality (XR)** in meaningful and creative ways within the context of **cultural heritage**.

## ðŸ§° What's inside the toolkit?

The HIT-KIT provides hands-on resources to help you design immersive experiences that connect people to cultural heritage. It includes:

* **Tutorials** for working with electronics, XR, and Unreal Engine
* A **digital workbook** to guide and inspire your design process
* The **Immersive Heritage Design Deck** with use cases, design prompts, and insights for meaningful XR applications in heritage
* **Digital building blocks** (code templates) to help you prototype with the ItsyBitsy and Unreal Engine

This GitHub repository contains all the digital elements of the toolkit.

## ðŸ’¡ Why would you use this toolkit?

Many designers are curious about XR but arenâ€™t sure where to startâ€”especially when it comes to combining it with electronics or applying it to heritage projects. The HIT-KIT makes XR accessible by:

* Breaking down technical barriers
* Offering structured guidance through the design process
* Helping you use XR intentionally and meaningfully in heritage contexts

Whether you're experimenting with embodied interaction or looking to build a prototype, this toolkit supports you from concept to creation.

## ðŸš€ How to get started

1. Start with the [**digital workbook**](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVJfhnfbI=/?share_link_id=575552301919) folder to follow the design process step by step.
2. After finishing the activities in the digital workbook, you should have a clear vision on the experience you want to create and how you can do this.
3. Browse the **Immersive Heritage Design Deck** for ideas and insights.
4. 3. Use the **digital building blocks** to begin prototyping in Unreal Engine or with your ItsyBitsy microcontroller.

> Youâ€™ll need a Connected Interaction Kit with the ItsyBitsy microcontroller and sensors to follow along fully.

## ðŸ’¬ Want to get in contact?

The HIT-KIT was created by **Hanne Bosma** as part of the master thesis from Integrated Product Design at the faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at TU Delft.
